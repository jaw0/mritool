Ports in JLisp
==============

ports are the object we use for i/o

we can open a file:

	(open:read "filename")
	(open:write "foo.bar")
	(open:read/write "Glark.doc")
	(open:append "work.log")

or a pipe:

	(open:read "| finger bob@host")
	(open:write "| mail bob@host")

or a string:

	(open:string "A string to be read and written to")

i/o operations on a port:


	(read [port])
	(display [port])
	(write [port])		all read/write lisp forms

	(getc port)
	(putc port char)
	(ungetc port char)	character at a time 

	(flush port)
	(seek port offset)
	(tell port)		administrative tasks to ports


ports need not be expicitly closed (can't be actually)
they will be closed at exit or if GCed
